## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, Dynamic Programming
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-length-of-valid-subsequence-ii/)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`.  
A subsequence `sub` of `nums` with length `x` is called **valid** if it satisfies:

```
(sub[0] + sub[1]) % k == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % k == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % k
```

Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of `nums`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Example

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`  
Output: `5`  
Explanation: The longest valid subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.


## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
- `1 <= k <= 10^3`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we use dynamic programming and modular arithmetic:

### Walkthrough

1. **Fix the Target Modulo Value:**  
   For a valid subsequence, the value of `(sub[0] + sub[1]) % k` must be the same for all consecutive pairs. There are `k` possible values for this modulo.

2. **DP State:**  
   Let `dp[i]` be the maximum length of a valid subsequence ending with an element whose value modulo `k` is `i`.

3. **Transition:**  
   For each `num` in `nums`, and for each target modulo value `val`,  
   - The previous element in the subsequence must have a modulo value `prev_mod = (k + val - (num % k)) % k`.
   - So, we can extend the best subsequence ending with `prev_mod` by adding `num`.

4. **Implementation:**  
   For each possible `val` from `0` to `k-1`, we iterate through `nums` and update the `dp` array. The answer is the maximum value in `dp` after processing.

### Complexity

- Time: O(k * n), where n is the length of `nums` and k is the modulo value.
- Space: O(k) for the DP array.

### Python Code

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        max_length = 0

        for val in range(k):

            dp = [0] * k
            for num in nums:
                prev_mod = (k + val - (num % k)) % k
                dp[num % k] = max(dp[num % k], dp[prev_mod] + 1)
            max_length = max(max_length, max(dp))
            
        return max_length
```
