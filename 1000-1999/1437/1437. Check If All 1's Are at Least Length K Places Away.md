# 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array

## Description

(You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`. Return `true` if all `1`s in the array are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.)

## Examples

(- Input: `nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]`, `k = 2`

- Output: `true`
- Explanation: Each of the `1`s are at least 2 places away from each other.

- Input: `nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: The second `1` and third `1` are only one apart from each other.)

## Constraints

(- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

- `0 <= k <= nums.length`)

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate through nums**: Track the distance from the previous `1`.

2. **Check distance**: If another `1` is found and the distance is less than `k`, return `False`.

3. **Update distance**: Reset distance after each `1`, increment otherwise.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** (O(n), where n is the length of `nums`)
- **Space:** (O(1), only a few variables used)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        n = len(nums)
        curr_dist = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if nums[i] == 1:
                if curr_dist != -1 and curr_dist < k:
                    return False
                curr_dist = 0
            else:
                if curr_dist != -1:
                    curr_dist += 1
        return True
```
