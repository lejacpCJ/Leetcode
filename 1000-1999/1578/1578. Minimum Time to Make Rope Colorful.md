## Description

Alice has `n` balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i`th balloon.

Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `neededTime` where `neededTime[i]` is the time (in seconds) that Bob needs to remove the `i`th balloon from the rope.

Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.

## Examples

- **Example 1:**

  - Input: `colors = "abaac"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]`
  - Output: `3`
  - Explanation: Remove the blue balloon at index 2 (cost 3). No two consecutive balloons have the same color.

- **Example 2:**

  - Input: `colors = "abc"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3]`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The rope is already colorful.

- **Example 3:**

  - Input: `colors = "aabaa"`, `neededTime = [1,2,3,4,1]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Remove balloons at indices 0 and 4 (cost 1 + 1 = 2).

## Constraints

- `n == colors.length == neededTime.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= neededTime[i] <= 10^4`
- `colors` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

1. **Iterate through the balloons:** For each group of consecutive balloons with the same color, we need to remove all but the one with the maximum neededTime.
2. **Accumulate removal cost:** For each group, sum all neededTime values and subtract the maximum in the group.
3. **Return the total minimum time.**

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Space:** O(1), only a few variables are used.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, colors: str, neededTime: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        n = len(colors)
        curr = ""
        curr_time = 0
        curr_max = 0
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if colors[i] != curr:
                if curr_time > curr_max:
                    res += curr_time - curr_max
                curr = colors[i]
                curr_time = neededTime[i]
                curr_max = neededTime[i]
            else:
                curr_time += neededTime[i]
                curr_max = max(curr_max, neededTime[i])
            i += 1

        if curr_time > curr_max:
            res += curr_time - curr_max

        return res
```
