## Description

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the smallest subarray (possibly empty) such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is not allowed to remove the whole array.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the array.

## Examples

- Input: `nums = [3,1,4,2]`, `p = 6`  
  Output: `1`  
  Explanation: The sum of the elements in nums is 10, which is not divisible by 6. We can remove the subarray `[4]`, and the sum of the remaining elements is 6, which is divisible by 6.

- Input: `nums = [6,3,5,2]`, `p = 9`  
  Output: `2`  
  Explanation: We cannot remove a single element to get a sum divisible by 9. The best way is to remove the subarray `[5,2]`, leaving us with `[6,3]` with sum 9.

- Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`, `p = 3`  
  Output: `0`  
  Explanation: Here the sum is 6, which is already divisible by 3. Thus we do not need to remove anything.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= p <= 10^9`

---

## Solution

1. **Calculate total sum:** Find the sum of all elements in `nums`.
2. **Check divisibility:** If the sum is already divisible by `p`, return 0.
3. **Prefix sum modulo:** Use a hash map to store prefix sums modulo `p` and their indices.
4. **Find minimal subarray:** For each prefix sum, check if removing a subarray ending at the current index makes the remaining sum divisible by `p`.
5. **Return result:** If no valid subarray is found, return -1.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Space:** O(n), for the hash map.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def minSubarray(self, nums: List[int], p: int) -> int:
        total = sum(nums)
        target = total % p
        if target == 0:
            return 0
        curr = 0
        ans = len(nums)
        seen = {0: -1}
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            curr = (curr + x) % p
            need = (curr - target) % p
            if need in seen:
                ans = min(ans, i - seen[need])
            seen[curr] = i
        return -1 if ans == len(nums) else ans
```
