## Description

Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.

Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

### Examples

#### Example 1

Input: `root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:

- Level 1 sum = 1
- Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7
- Level 3 sum = 7 + (-8) = -1  
  So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.

#### Example 2

Input: `root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]`  
Output: `2`

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10⁴].
- -10⁵ <= Node.val <= 10⁵

---

## Solution

1. **Level Order Traversal:** Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Sum Calculation:** For each level, calculate the sum of node values.
3. **Track Maximum:** Keep track of the maximum sum and its corresponding level.
4. **Return Smallest Level:** If multiple levels have the same sum, return the smallest level.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes (each node is visited once).
- **Space:** O(W), where W is the maximum width of the tree (queue size).

**Python Code:**

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxLevelSum(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        max_sum = float('-inf')
        max_level = 1
        level = 1
        queue = deque([root])

        while queue:
            level_sum = 0
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                node = queue.popleft()
                level_sum += node.val
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            if level_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = level_sum
                max_level = level
            level += 1

        return max_level
```
