# 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** String, Stack, Greedy
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/)

## Description

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

- Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.
  For example, when removing `"ab"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cxbae"`.
- Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.
  For example, when removing `"ba"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cabxe"`.

Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on `s`.

## Example

Input: `s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5`  
Output: `19`  
Explanation:
- Remove the `"ba"` underlined in `"cdbcbbaaabab"`. Now, `s = "cdbcbbaaab"` and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the `"ab"` underlined in `"cdbcbbaaab"`. Now, `s = "cdbcbbaa"` and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the `"ba"` underlined in `"cdbcbbaa"`. Now, `s = "cdbcba"` and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the `"ba"` underlined in `"cdbcba"`. Now, `s = "cdbc"` and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.


## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= x, y <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

Always remove the substring that gives more points first. Use a stack-based approach to efficiently find and remove substrings.

**Steps:**

1. Determine which substring (`"ab"` or `"ba"`) gives more points.
2. First pass: Remove all occurrences of the higher-scoring substring using a stack.
3. Second pass: Remove all occurrences of the lower-scoring substring from the remaining string.
4. Return the total score.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of string `s`. We make two passes through the string.
- **Space:** O(n), for the stack used in the removal process.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:

        def remove_substring(s: str, first: str, second: str, points: int) -> tuple:
            stack = []
            score = 0
            for char in s:
                if stack and stack[-1] == first and char == second:
                    stack.pop()
                    score += points
                else:
                    stack.append(char)
            return ''.join(stack), score
        
        if x >= y:
            s, score1 = remove_substring(s, 'a', 'b', x)
            s, score2 = remove_substring(s, 'b', 'a', y)
        else:
            s, score1 = remove_substring(s, 'b', 'a', y)
            s, score2 = remove_substring(s, 'a', 'b', x)
            
        return score1 + score2
```
