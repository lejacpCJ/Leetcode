## Description

On a social network consisting of `m` users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer `n`, an array `languages`, and an array `friendships` where:

- There are `n` languages numbered 1 through n,
- `languages[i]` is the set of languages the `i`th user knows,
- `friendships[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes a friendship between the users `u_i` and `v_i`.

You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive.

## Examples

- **Example 1:**

    - Input: `n = 2`, `languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]]`, `friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]`
    - Output: `1`
    - Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.

- **Example 2:**

    - Input: `n = 3`, `languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]]`, `friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]`
    - Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 500`
- `languages.length == m`
- `1 <= m <= 500`
- `1 <= languages[i].length <= n`
- `1 <= languages[i][j] <= n`
- `1 <= u_i < v_i <= languages.length`
- `1 <= friendships.length <= 500`
- All tuples `(u_i, v_i)` are unique
- `languages[i]` contains only unique values

---

## Solution

1. **Build language sets:** For each user, store the set of languages they know.
2. **Find users needing teaching:** For each friendship, if the two users do not share a language, add both to a set of users needing teaching.
3. **Try each language:** For each language, count how many users in the set above do not know it.
4. **Return the minimum:** The answer is the minimum number of users to teach for any language.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n * m), where n is the number of languages and m is the number of users.
- **Space:** O(m * n), for storing language sets.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumTeachings(self, n: int, languages: List[List[int]], friendships: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        lang_set = [set(l) for l in languages]
        need_fix = set()

        for u, v in friendships:
            if not (lang_set[u-1] & lang_set[v-1]):
                need_fix.add(u-1)
                need_fix.add(v-1)

        res = float('inf')

        for i in range(1, n+1):
            count = 0
            for user in need_fix:
                if i not in lang_set[user]:
                    count += 1
            res = min(res, count)

        return res
