## Description

There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters` of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in `text` you can fully type using this keyboard.

## Examples

- **Input:** `text = "hello world"`, `brokenLetters = "ad"`
  - **Output:** `1`
  - **Explanation:** We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

- **Input:** `text = "leet code"`, `brokenLetters = "lt"`
  - **Output:** `1`
  - **Explanation:** We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

- **Input:** `text = "leet code"`, `brokenLetters = "e"`
  - **Output:** `0`
  - **Explanation:** We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.

## Constraints

- `1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
- `text` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
- Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
- `brokenLetters` consists of distinct lowercase English letters.

## Solution

1. **Split the text:** Divide the input string into words.
2. **Check each word:** For each word, check if it contains any broken letter.
3. **Count valid words:** If a word does not contain any broken letter, increment the result counter.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the average word length.
- **Space:** O(N), for storing the list of words.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def canBeTypedWords(self, text: str, brokenLetters: str) -> int:
        lst = text.split()
        res = 0

        for word in lst:
            isValid = True
            for char in brokenLetters:
                if char in word:
                    isValid = False
                    break
            if isValid:
                res += 1
        return res
```
