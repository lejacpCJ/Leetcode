## Description

You are given a 2D array `points` of size `n x 2` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

Count the number of pairs of points (A, B), where:

- A is on the upper left side of B, and
- there are no other points in the rectangle (or line) they make (including the border).

Return the count.

## Examples

### Example 1

- **Input:** `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`
- **Output:** `0`
- **Explanation:**  
  There is no way to choose A and B so A is on the upper left side of B.

### Example 2

- **Input:** `points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:**  
  - The pair (points[1], points[0]): points[1] is on the upper left side of points[0] and the rectangle is empty.
  - The pair (points[2], points[1]): points[2] is on the upper left side of points[1] and the rectangle is empty.
  - The pair (points[2], points[0]): points[2] is on the upper left side of points[0], but points[1] is inside the rectangle so it's not a valid pair.

### Example 3

- **Input:** `points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:**  
  - The pair (points[2], points[0]): points[2] is on the upper left side of points[0] and there are no other points on the line they form.
  - The pair (points[1], points[2]): points[1] is on the upper left side of points[2] and the rectangle is empty.
  - The pair (points[1], points[0]): points[1] is on the upper left side of points[0], but points[2] is on the border of the rectangle, so it's not valid.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 50`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 50`
- All `points[i]` are distinct.

---

## Solution

1. **Sort the points** by x ascending and y descending.
2. **Iterate through each point** as the left point.
3. **For each right point**, check if it is below the left point and not blocked by any other point.
4. **Count valid pairs** using a greedy approach.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(nÂ²), where n is the number of points.
- **Space:** O(1), only counters and variables.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Sort points by x ascending, y descending
        points.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(points) - 1):
            max_height = points[i][1]  # y of the left point
            valid_height = -float('inf')  # Track the lowest y that blocks further pairs
            for j in range(i+1, len(points)):
                # Skip if right point is above left point
                if points[j][1] > max_height:
                    continue
                # If right point is on the same horizontal line, count and break (no more valid below)
                if points[j][1] == max_height:
                    res += 1
                    break
                # Skip if blocked by a previous point
                if points[j][1] <= valid_height:
                    continue
                # Update the lowest blocking y and count this pair
                valid_height = max(valid_height, points[j][1])
                res += 1
        return res
