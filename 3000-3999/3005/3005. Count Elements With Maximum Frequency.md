## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Counting
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/)

## Description

You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Return the total frequencies of elements in nums such that those elements all have the maximum frequency.

The frequency of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

## Examples

Example 1:
- Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
- Output: 4
- Explanation: The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.  
  So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.

Example 2:
- Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
- Output: 5
- Explanation: All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.  
  So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.

## Constraints

- 1 <= nums.length <= 100
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 100

---

## Solution

1. Count frequencies of each distinct element using a hash map.
2. Determine the maximum frequency.
3. Iterate through nums and count every occurrence of elements whose frequency equals the maximum.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxFrequencyElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        freqs = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            freqs[num] += 1
        max_freq = max(freqs.values())

        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            if freqs[num] == max_freq:
                res += 1

        return res
```
