# 3432. Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Math, Prefix Sum
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-partitions-with-even-sum-difference/)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

A partition is defined as an index `i` where `0 <= i < n - 1`, splitting the array into two non-empty subarrays such that:

- Left subarray contains indices `[0, i]`.
- Right subarray contains indices `[i + 1, n - 1]`.

Return the number of partitions where the difference between the sum of the left and right subarrays is even.

## Examples

- **Input:** `nums = [10,10,3,7,6]`  
  **Output:** `4`  
  **Explanation:**  
  The 4 partitions are:

  - `[10], [10, 3, 7, 6]` with a sum difference of `10 - 26 = -16`, which is even.
  - `[10, 10], [3, 7, 6]` with a sum difference of `20 - 16 = 4`, which is even.
  - `[10, 10, 3], [7, 6]` with a sum difference of `23 - 13 = 10`, which is even.
  - `[10, 10, 3, 7], [6]` with a sum difference of `30 - 6 = 24`, which is even.

- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,2]`  
  **Output:** `0`  
  **Explanation:**  
  No partition results in an even sum difference.

- **Input:** `nums = [2,4,6,8]`  
  **Output:** `3`  
  **Explanation:**  
  All partitions result in an even sum difference.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n == nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## Solution

1. **Calculate total sum:** Compute the sum of all elements in `nums`.
2. **Iterate through possible partitions:** For each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`, maintain a prefix sum of the left subarray.
3. **Check even difference:** For each partition, check if the difference between the left and right subarray sums is even.
4. **Count valid partitions:** Increment the answer if the difference is even.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Space:** O(1), only a few variables are used.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countPartitions(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        sum_nums = sum(nums)
        pre_sum = 0
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            pre_sum += nums[i]
            diff = sum_nums - pre_sum * 2
            if diff % 2 == 0:
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
