# 3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, Sorting, Matrix
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-matrix-by-diagonals/)

## Description

You are given an n x n square matrix of integers `grid`. Return the matrix such that:

- The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The diagonals in the top-right triangle are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Example 1

**Input:**  
`grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]`

**Output:**  
`[[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]`

**Explanation:**  
The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:  
- `[1, 8, 6]` becomes `[8, 6, 1]`.
- `[9, 5]` and `[4]` remain unchanged.

The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:  
- `[7, 2]` becomes `[2, 7]`.
- `[3]` remains unchanged.

### Example 2

**Input:**  
`grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]`

**Output:**  
`[[2,1],[1,0]]`

**Explanation:**  
The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so `[0, 2]` is changed to `[2, 0]`. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

### Example 3

**Input:**  
`grid = [[1]]`

**Output:**  
`[[1]]`

**Explanation:**  
Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.

## Constraints

- `grid.length == grid[i].length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `-10^5 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5`

## Solution

1. **Sort bottom-left diagonals (including the main diagonal) in non-increasing order:**  
   For each diagonal starting from the first column, collect elements, sort in reverse, and put them back.

2. **Sort top-right diagonals in non-decreasing order:**  
   For each diagonal starting from the first row (excluding the main diagonal), collect elements, sort, and put them back.

**Complexity:**  
- **Time:** O(nÂ²), since each element is visited once and sorting is on at most n elements per diagonal.
- **Space:** O(n) for temporary diagonal storage.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sortMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(grid)

        # Sort bottom-left diagonals (including main diagonal) in non-increasing order
        for diag in range(n):
            i, j = diag, 0
            diagonal = []
            while i < n and j < n:
                diagonal.append(grid[i][j])
                i += 1
                j += 1
            diagonal.sort(reverse=True)
            i, j = diag, 0
            for num in diagonal:
                grid[i][j] = num
                i += 1
                j += 1

        # Sort top-right diagonals in non-decreasing order
        for diag in range(1, n):
            i, j = 0, diag
            diagonal = []
            while i < n and j < n:
                diagonal.append(grid[i][j])
                i += 1
                j += 1
            diagonal.sort()
            i, j = 0, diag
            for num in diagonal:
                grid[i][j] = num
                i += 1
                j += 1

        return grid
```
