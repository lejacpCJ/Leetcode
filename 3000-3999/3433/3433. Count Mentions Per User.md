## Description

You are given an integer `numberOfUsers` representing the total number of users and an array `events` of size n x 3.

Each `events[i]` can be either of the following two types:

- **Message Event:** `["MESSAGE", "timestampi", "mentions_stringi"]`

  - This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at `timestampi`.
  - The `mentions_stringi` string can contain one of the following tokens:
    - `id<number>`: where `<number>` is an integer in range `[0, numberOfUsers - 1]`. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
    - `ALL`: mentions all users.
    - `HERE`: mentions all online users.

- **Offline Event:** `["OFFLINE", "timestampi", "idi"]`
  - This event indicates that the user `idi` had become offline at `timestampi` for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time `timestampi + 60`.

All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.

Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.

Return an array `mentions` where `mentions[i]` represents the number of mentions the user with id `i` has across all MESSAGE events.

## Examples

### Example 1

- **Input:** `numberOfUsers = 2`, `events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","71","HERE"]]`
- **Output:** `[2,2]`
- **Explanation:**
  - Initially, all users are online.
  - At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
  - At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
  - At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and "HERE" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]

### Example 2

- **Input:** `numberOfUsers = 2`, `events = [["MESSAGE","10","id1 id0"],["OFFLINE","11","0"],["MESSAGE","12","ALL"]]`
- **Output:** `[2,2]`
- **Explanation:**
  - At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
  - At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
  - At timestamp 12, "ALL" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]

### Example 3

- **Input:** `numberOfUsers = 2`, `events = [["OFFLINE","10","0"],["MESSAGE","12","HERE"]]`
- **Output:** `[0,1]`
- **Explanation:**
  - At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.
  - At timestamp 12, "HERE" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]

## Constraints

- `1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100`
- `1 <= events.length <= 100`
- `events[i].length == 3`
- `events[i][0]` will be one of MESSAGE or OFFLINE.
- `1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 10^5`
- The number of id<number> mentions in any "MESSAGE" event is between 1 and 100.
- `0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1`
- It is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the OFFLINE event is online at the time the event occurs.

---

## Solution

1. **Sort events** by timestamp, and for the same timestamp, process OFFLINE events before MESSAGE events.
2. **Track user status** (online/offline) and when users should come back online using a queue.
3. **Process events**:
   - For OFFLINE: mark user offline and schedule their return.
   - For MESSAGE:
     - If "ALL": increment all users' mention counts.
     - If "HERE": increment mention counts for online users only.
     - If "id<number> ...": increment mention counts for each id (including duplicates).
4. **Restore users** who come back online before processing events at the same or later timestamp.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n \* m), where n is the number of events and m is the number of users (worst case for "ALL" or "HERE").
- **Space:** O(n + m), for status and queue.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List
import collections

class Solution:
    def countMentions(self, numberOfUsers: int, events: List[List[str]]) -> List[int]:
        # Sort events by timestamp, OFFLINE before MESSAGE at same timestamp
        events = sorted(events, key=lambda x: (int(x[1]), 0 if x[0] == "OFFLINE" else 1))
        mentions = [0] * numberOfUsers
        status = [1] * numberOfUsers  # 1 = online, 0 = offline
        offline_queue = collections.deque()  # (user_id, online_time)

        for event in events:
            msg_type, time, mention_str = event
            time = int(time)
            # Restore users who should be online by now
            while offline_queue and offline_queue[0][1] <= time:
                off_id, _ = offline_queue.popleft()
                status[off_id] = 1

            if msg_type == "MESSAGE":
                if mention_str == "HERE":
                    for i, stat in enumerate(status):
                        if stat == 1:
                            mentions[i] += 1
                elif mention_str == "ALL":
                    for i in range(numberOfUsers):
                        mentions[i] += 1
                else:
                    ids = mention_str.split()
                    for idx in ids:
                        idx_num = int(idx[2:])
                        mentions[idx_num] += 1
            else:  # OFFLINE
                idx = int(mention_str)
                status[idx] = 0
                offline_queue.append((idx, time + 60))

        return mentions
```
