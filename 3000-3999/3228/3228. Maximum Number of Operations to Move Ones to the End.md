# 3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** String, Greedy, Counting
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-operations-to-move-ones-to-the-end/)

## Description

You are given a binary string `s`.

You can perform the following operation on the string any number of times:

- Choose any index `i` from the string where `i + 1 < s.length` such that `s[i] == '1'` and `s[i + 1] == '0'`.
- Move the character `s[i]` to the right until it reaches the end of the string or another `'1'`. For example, for `s = "010010"`, if we choose `i = 1`, the resulting string will be `s = "000110"`.

Return the maximum number of operations that you can perform.

## Examples

- Input: `s = "1001101"`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation:

  - Choose index `i = 0`. The resulting string is `s = "0011101"`.
  - Choose index `i = 4`. The resulting string is `s = "0011011"`.
  - Choose index `i = 3`. The resulting string is `s = "0010111"`.
  - Choose index `i = 2`. The resulting string is `s = "0001111"`.

- Input: `s = "00111"`
- Output: `0`

## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

1. **Count zeros to the right:** Iterate from right to left, counting the number of zeros that can be swapped with ones.
2. **For each '1':** Add the number of zeros to its right that can be swapped.
3. **Greedy approach:** Each '1' can be moved past all zeros to its right, but only if it is immediately followed by a zero.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Space:** O(1), only a few counters are used.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        suffix_zero = 0
        res = 0
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if i == n - 1 and s[i] == "0":
                suffix_zero += 1
            elif s[i] == "0":
                if s[i+1] != "0":
                    suffix_zero += 1
            else:
                res += suffix_zero
        return res
```
