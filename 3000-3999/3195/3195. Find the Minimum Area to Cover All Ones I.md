# 3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, Matrix

## Description

You are given a 2D binary array `grid`. Find a rectangle with horizontal and vertical sides with the smallest area, such that all the 1's in `grid` lie inside this rectangle.

Return the minimum possible area of the rectangle.

## Examples

- **Input:** `grid = [[0,1,0],[1,0,1]]`  
  **Output:** `6`  
  **Explanation:**  
  The smallest rectangle has a height of 2 and a width of 3, so it has an area of 2 * 3 = 6.

- **Input:** `grid = [[1,0],[0,0]]`  
  **Output:** `1`  
  **Explanation:**  
  The smallest rectangle has both height and width 1, so its area is 1 * 1 = 1.

## Constraints

- `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 1000`
- `grid[i][j]` is either 0 or 1.
- The input is generated such that there is at least one 1 in `grid`.

---

## Solution

1. **Find bounds:** Iterate through the grid to find the minimum and maximum row and column indices where a 1 appears.
2. **Calculate area:** The rectangle covering all 1's will have its top-left corner at `(min_x, min_y)` and bottom-right at `(max_x, max_y)`. The area is `(max_x - min_x + 1) * (max_y - min_y + 1)`.

**Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid.
- **Space:** O(1), only variables for bounds are used.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumArea(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        min_x, min_y = 1001, 1001
        max_x, max_y = -1, -1
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    min_x = min(min_x, i)
                    min_y = min(min_y, j)
                    max_x = max(max_x, i)
                    max_y = max(max_y, j)

        return (max_x - min_x + 1) * (max_y - min_y + 1)
```
