# 3508. Implement Router

## Problem Info

- Difficulty: Medium
- Topics: Array, Hash Table, Binary Search, Design, Queue, Ordered Set

## Description

Design a Router data structure that stores incoming data packets with attributes:

- source (int)
- destination (int)
- timestamp (int)

Router(memoryLimit) initializes with fixed memory capacity. Behavior:

- memoryLimit is the maximum number of packets stored. If adding a packet would exceed the limit, evict the oldest packet (FIFO).
- addPacket(source, destination, timestamp) adds the packet if it is not a duplicate (same source, destination, timestamp already stored). Returns true if added, false if duplicate.
- forwardPacket() forwards (removes and returns) the next packet in FIFO order as [source, destination, timestamp]. Returns [] if none.
- getCount(destination, startTime, endTime) returns number of stored packets with given destination and timestamp in [startTime, endTime].

Note: addPacket queries arrive with non-decreasing timestamps.

## Examples

Example 1:
Input:
["Router", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "addPacket", "getCount"]
[[3], [1, 4, 90], [2, 5, 90], [1, 4, 90], [3, 5, 95], [4, 5, 105], [], [5, 2, 110], [5, 100, 110]]

Output:
[null, true, true, false, true, true, [2, 5, 90], true, 1]

Example 2:
Input:
["Router", "addPacket", "forwardPacket", "forwardPacket"]
[[2], [7, 4, 90], [], []]

Output:
[null, true, [7, 4, 90], []]

## Constraints

- 2 <= memoryLimit <= 10^5
- 1 <= source, destination <= 2 \* 10^5
- 1 <= timestamp <= 10^9
- 1 <= startTime <= endTime <= 10^9
- At most 10^5 calls total.
- addPacket calls have non-decreasing timestamps.

## Solution

Approach:

- Maintain a FIFO queue (collections.deque) of packets to support ordering and evictions.
- Use a set of tuple keys (source, destination, timestamp) to detect duplicates in O(1).
- For getCount per destination, maintain a dict mapping destination -> list of timestamps kept in non-decreasing order. Because addPacket timestamps are globally non-decreasing, appending to each destination list keeps it sorted. For queries, use binary search (bisect_left/right) to count timestamps in the range.
- When evicting (either due to memoryLimit or forwardPacket), remove the packet from the queue, the duplicate set, and remove one occurrence of its timestamp from the destination list using bisect_left and pop.

Complexities:

- addPacket: O(1) average for duplicate check and append; O(log m) for appending and O(k) for removing from a destination list when evicting (k = length of that destination list). Overall expected efficient for 1e5 ops given additions are monotonic.
- forwardPacket: O(log m + k) to remove timestamp from destination list.
- getCount: O(log m) where m is number of packets for that destination.

## Python Implementation

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict
import bisect

class Router:
    def __init__(self, memoryLimit: int):
        self.limit = memoryLimit
        self.q = deque()  # stores (source, destination, timestamp)
        self.exists = set()  # set of (source, destination, timestamp) for duplicate check
        self.dest_times = defaultdict(list)  # destination -> sorted list of timestamps

    def addPacket(self, source: int, destination: int, timestamp: int) -> bool:
        key = (source, destination, timestamp)
        if key in self.exists:
            return False
        # add packet
        self.q.append((source, destination, timestamp))
        self.exists.add(key)
        # because addPacket timestamps are non-decreasing globally, append keeps list sorted
        self.dest_times[destination].append(timestamp)
        # ensure memory limit: if exceeded, evict oldest once
        if len(self.q) > self.limit:
            # evict oldest
            src, dst, ts = self.q.popleft()
            self.exists.discard((src, dst, ts))
            lst = self.dest_times[dst]
            i = bisect.bisect_left(lst, ts)
            if i < len(lst) and lst[i] == ts:
                lst.pop(i)
            if not lst:
                del self.dest_times[dst]
        return True

    def forwardPacket(self):
        if not self.q:
            return []
        src, dst, ts = self.q.popleft()
        self.exists.discard((src, dst, ts))
        lst = self.dest_times[dst]
        i = bisect.bisect_left(lst, ts)
        if i < len(lst) and lst[i] == ts:
            lst.pop(i)
        if not lst:
            del self.dest_times[dst]
        return [src, dst, ts]

    def getCount(self, destination: int, startTime: int, endTime: int) -> int:
        if destination not in self.dest_times:
            return 0
        lst = self.dest_times[destination]
        l = bisect.bisect_left(lst, startTime)
        r = bisect.bisect_right(lst, endTime)
        return r - l
```
