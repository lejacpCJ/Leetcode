## Description

You are given a 2D array `points` of size `n x 2` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`.

We define the right direction as positive x-axis (increasing x-coordinate) and the left direction as negative x-axis (decreasing x-coordinate). Similarly, we define the up direction as positive y-axis (increasing y-coordinate) and the down direction as negative y-axis (decreasing y-coordinate).

You have to place `n` people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person at every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so Alice will build a rectangular fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner of the fence (Note that the fence might not enclose any area, i.e. it can be a line). If any person other than Alice and Bob is either inside the fence or on the fence, Alice will be sad.

Return the number of pairs of points where you can place Alice and Bob, such that Alice does not become sad on building the fence.

Note that Alice can only build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner, and Bob's position as the lower right corner.

## Examples

- **Input:** `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`
  **Output:** `0`
  **Explanation:** There is no way to place Alice and Bob such that Alice can build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner. Hence we return 0.

- **Input:** `points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]]`
  **Output:** `2`
  **Explanation:** There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad:
    - Place Alice at (4, 4) and Bob at (6, 2).
    - Place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (4, 4).
    You cannot place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (6, 2) because the person at (4, 4) will be inside the fence.

- **Input:** `points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]]`
  **Output:** `2`
  **Explanation:** There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad:
    - Place Alice at (1, 1) and Bob at (3, 1).
    - Place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (1, 1).
    You cannot place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (3, 1) because the person at (1, 1) will be on the fence.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-10^9 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^9`
- All `points[i]` are distinct.

---

## Solution

1. **Sort points:** Sort points by x ascending, then y descending.
2. **Iterate pairs:** For each point, try to pair it with every point to its right, maintaining the highest y seen so far.
3. **Check heights:** Only count pairs where the second point's y is not above the first, and no other point is inside/on the fence.
4. **Count valid pairs:** Increment result for each valid pair.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(nÂ²), as we check each pair.
- **Space:** O(1), only variables for counting.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numberOfPairs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(points) - 1):
            max_height = points[i][1]
            valid_height = -float('inf')
            for j in range(i+1, len(points)):
                if points[j][1] > max_height:
                    continue
                if points[j][1] == max_height:
                    res += 1
                    break
                if points[j][1] <= valid_height:
                    continue
                valid_height = max(valid_height, points[j][1])
                res += 1
        return res
```
