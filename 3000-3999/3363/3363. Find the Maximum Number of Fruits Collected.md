## Description

There is a game dungeon comprised of `n x n` rooms arranged in a grid.

You are given a 2D array `fruits` of size `n x n`, where `fruits[i][j]` represents the number of fruits in the room `(i, j)`. Three children will play in the game dungeon, with initial positions at the corner rooms `(0, 0)`, `(0, n - 1)`, and `(n - 1, 0)`.

The children will make exactly `n - 1` moves according to the following rules to reach the room `(n - 1, n - 1)`:

- The child starting from `(0, 0)` must move from their current room `(i, j)` to one of the rooms `(i + 1, j + 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i, j + 1)` if the target room exists.
- The child starting from `(0, n - 1)` must move from their current room `(i, j)` to one of the rooms `(i + 1, j - 1)`, `(i + 1, j)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the target room exists.
- The child starting from `(n - 1, 0)` must move from their current room `(i, j)` to one of the rooms `(i - 1, j + 1)`, `(i, j + 1)`, and `(i + 1, j + 1)` if the target room exists.

When a child enters a room, they will collect all the fruits there. If two or more children enter the same room, only one child will collect the fruits, and the room will be emptied after they leave.

Return the maximum number of fruits the children can collect from the dungeon.

## Examples

- Input: `fruits = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,8,7],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]]`
- Output: `100`
- Explanation: The 1st child (green) moves on the path `(0,0) -> (1,1) -> (2,2) -> (3, 3)`. The 2nd child (red) moves on the path `(0,3) -> (1,2) -> (2,3) -> (3, 3)`. The 3rd child (blue) moves on the path `(3,0) -> (3,1) -> (3,2) -> (3, 3)`. In total they collect `1 + 6 + 11 + 16 + 4 + 8 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 100` fruits.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n == fruits.length == fruits[i].length <= 1000`
- `0 <= fruits[i][j] <= 1000`

---

## Solution

1. **Separate Path Optimization**: Since each child has different movement constraints, solve each path independently
2. **Player 1 (Diagonal Path)**: Child from `(0, 0)` can only move diagonally to `(n-1, n-1)`, collecting `fruits[i][i]` for all `i`
3. **Player 2 (Upper Triangle)**: Child from `(0, n-1)` uses DP to find optimal path while staying in upper triangle (`j > i`)
4. **Player 3 (Lower Triangle)**: Child from `(n-1, 0)` uses DP to find optimal path while staying in lower triangle (`i > j`)
5. **Final Sum**: Add all three players' maximum collections

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** `O(n^2)`, processing each cell once for each player's DP
- **Space:** `O(n^2)`, for the DP tables for players `2` and `3`

**Python Code:**

        # Handle final position for player 3
        player3[n - 1][n - 1] = max(player3[n - 1][n - 2], player3[n - 2][n - 2])

        return player1 + player2[n - 1][n - 1] + player3[n - 1][n - 1]
