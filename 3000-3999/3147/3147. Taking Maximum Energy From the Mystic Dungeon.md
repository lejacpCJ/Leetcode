## Description

In a mystic dungeon, `n` magicians are standing in a line. Each magician has an attribute that gives you energy. Some magicians can give you negative energy, which means taking energy from you.

You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician `i`, you will be instantly transported to magician `(i + k)`. This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where `(i + k)` does not exist.

In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with `k` jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, absorbing all the energy during the journey.

You are given an array `energy` and an integer `k`. Return the maximum possible energy you can gain.

Note that when you reach a magician, you must take energy from them, whether it is negative or positive energy.

## Examples

- **Input:** `energy = [5,2,-10,-5,1]`, `k = 3`  
  **Output:** `3`  
  **Explanation:** We can gain a total energy of 3 by starting from magician 1, absorbing 2 + 1 = 3.

- **Input:** `energy = [-2,-3,-1]`, `k = 2`  
  **Output:** `-1`  
  **Explanation:** We can gain a total energy of -1 by starting from magician 2.

## Constraints

- `1 <= energy.length <= 10^5`
- `-1000 <= energy[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= energy.length - 1`

---

## Solution

1. **Observation:**  
   For each possible starting index `i` (from `0` to `k-1`), you can only visit indices of the form `i, i+k, i+2k, ...`.  
   For each such sequence, you want the maximum sum you can get by starting at any position in that sequence.

2. **Approach:**
   - For each modulo class `i % k`, keep track of the maximum subarray sum ending at each position.
   - Use a list `lst` of size `k` to store the best sum for each modulo class.
   - For each position, update the corresponding `lst` entry with the maximum of extending the previous sum or starting fresh from the current position.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(k)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumEnergy(self, energy: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        lst = [0] * k
        for i in range(len(energy)):
            idx = i % k
            lst[idx] = max(lst[idx] + energy[i], energy[i])
        return max(lst)
```
