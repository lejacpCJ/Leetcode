## Description

Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a field, with two lanes of flowers between them. There are `x` flowers in the first lane between Alice and Bob, and `y` flowers in the second lane between them.

The game proceeds as follows:

- Alice takes the first turn.
- In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lanes and pick one flower from that side.
- At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.

Given two integers, `n` and `m`, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions:

- Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
- The number of flowers `x` in the first lane must be in the range `[1, n]`.
- The number of flowers `y` in the second lane must be in the range `[1, m]`.

Return the number of possible pairs `(x, y)` that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement.

## Examples

- **Input:** `n = 3, m = 2`  
  **Output:** `3`  
  **Explanation:** The following pairs satisfy the conditions: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).

- **Input:** `n = 1, m = 1`  
  **Output:** `0`  
  **Explanation:** No pairs satisfy the conditions.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`

---

## Solution

To determine the number of pairs `(x, y)` where Alice wins, notice that Alice wins if and only if the sum `x + y` is odd (since Alice starts, and the parity of the total number of flowers determines who makes the last move).

- For each odd sum, Alice wins.
- The number of pairs with odd sum is `(number of odd x) * (number of even y) + (number of even x) * (number of odd y)`.

Let:
- `odd_n = n // 2 + n % 2` (number of odd numbers in [1, n])
- `even_n = n // 2` (number of even numbers in [1, n])
- `odd_m = m // 2 + m % 2`
- `even_m = m // 2`

So, the answer is: `odd_n * even_m + even_n * odd_m`

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(1)
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def flowerGame(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        odd_n = n // 2 + n % 2
        even_n = n // 2
        odd_m = m // 2 + m % 2
        even_m = m // 2
        return odd_n * even_m + even_n * odd_m
```
