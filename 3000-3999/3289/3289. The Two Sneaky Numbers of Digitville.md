## Description

In the town of Digitville, there was a list of numbers called `nums` containing integers from 0 to n - 1. Each number was supposed to appear exactly once in the list, however, two mischievous numbers sneaked in an additional time, making the list longer than usual.

As the town detective, your task is to find these two sneaky numbers. Return an array of size two containing the two numbers (in any order), so peace can return to Digitville.

## Examples

- Input: `nums = [0,1,1,0]`  
  Output: `[0,1]`  
  Explanation: The numbers 0 and 1 each appear twice in the array.

- Input: `nums = [0,3,2,1,3,2]`  
  Output: `[2,3]`  
  Explanation: The numbers 2 and 3 each appear twice in the array.

- Input: `nums = [7,1,5,4,3,4,6,0,9,5,8,2]`  
  Output: `[4,5]`  
  Explanation: The numbers 4 and 5 each appear twice in the array.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `nums.length == n + 2`
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
- The input is generated such that nums contains exactly two repeated elements.

## Solution

1. **Use a set to track seen numbers:**  
   Iterate through the array and add each number to a set.
2. **Detect duplicates:**  
   If a number is already in the set, add it to the result list.
3. **Return the result:**  
   The result list will contain the two sneaky numbers.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space:** O(n), for the set and result list.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def getSneakyNumbers(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        num_set = set()
        res = []
        for num in nums:
            if num in num_set:
                res.append(num)
            else:
                num_set.add(num)
        return res
```
