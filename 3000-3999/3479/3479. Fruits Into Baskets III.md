# 3479. Fruits Into Baskets III

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, Binary Search, Segment Tree, Ordered Set
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruits-into-baskets-iii/)

## Description

You are given two arrays of integers, `fruits` and `baskets`, each of length `n`, where `fruits[i]` represents the quantity of the ith type of fruit, and `baskets[j]` represents the capacity of the jth basket.

From left to right, place the fruits according to these rules:

1. Each fruit type must be placed in the leftmost available basket with a capacity greater than or equal to the quantity of that fruit type.
2. Each basket can hold only one type of fruit.
3. If a fruit type cannot be placed in any basket, it remains unplaced.

Return the number of fruit types that remain unplaced after all possible allocations are made.

## Example

Input: `fruits = [4,2,5], baskets = [3,5,4]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: 
- `fruits[0] = 4` is placed in `baskets[1] = 5`.
- `fruits[1] = 2` is placed in `baskets[0] = 3`.
- `fruits[2] = 5` cannot be placed in `baskets[2] = 4`.
- Since one fruit type remains unplaced, we return 1.

Input: `fruits = [3,6,1], baskets = [6,4,7]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:
- `fruits[0] = 3` is placed in `baskets[0] = 6`.
- `fruits[1] = 6` cannot be placed in `baskets[1] = 4` but can be placed in `baskets[2] = 7`.
- `fruits[2] = 1` is placed in `baskets[1] = 4`.
- Since all fruits are successfully placed, we return 0.

## Constraints

- `n == fruits.length == baskets.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= fruits[i], baskets[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution

**Steps:**

The key insight is to use a combination of sorting and segment tree to efficiently find the leftmost available basket for each fruit type.

1. **Sort Baskets**:
   - Create pairs of `(capacity, original_index)` for all baskets
   - Sort them by capacity to enable binary search

2. **Segment Tree for Minimum Index**:
   - Use segment tree to maintain the smallest original index for each capacity range
   - This allows us to find the leftmost available basket efficiently

3. **Process Each Fruit**:
   - For each fruit from left to right, use binary search to find valid baskets
   - Query segment tree for the leftmost available basket with sufficient capacity
   - Mark used baskets by setting their values to infinity

4. **Count Unplaced Fruits**:
   - If no valid basket is found for a fruit, increment the unplaced counter

**Complexity:**  

- **Time:** O(n log n), for sorting and segment tree operations
- **Space:** O(n), for the segment tree and auxiliary arrays

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List
import bisect

class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.n = len(arr)
        self.tree = [float('inf')] * (4 * self.n)
        self.build(arr, 0, 0, self.n - 1)
    
    def build(self, arr, node, start, end):
        if start == end:
            self.tree[node] = arr[start]
        else:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            self.build(arr, 2 * node + 1, start, mid)
            self.build(arr, 2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end)
            self.tree[node] = min(self.tree[2 * node + 1], self.tree[2 * node + 2])
    
    def query(self, node, start, end, l, r):
        if r < start or end < l:
            return float('inf')
        if l <= start and end <= r:
            return self.tree[node]
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        return min(self.query(2 * node + 1, start, mid, l, r),
                   self.query(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, l, r))
    
    def update(self, node, start, end, idx, val):
        if start == end:
            self.tree[node] = val
        else:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if idx <= mid:
                self.update(2 * node + 1, start, mid, idx, val)
            else:
                self.update(2 * node + 2, mid + 1, end, idx, val)
            self.tree[node] = min(self.tree[2 * node + 1], self.tree[2 * node + 2])

    def numOfUnplacedFruits(self, fruits: List[int], baskets: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(fruits)

        idx_to_pos = {original_indices[i]: i for i in range(n)}
        
        # Initialize segment tree with original indices
        seg_tree = SegmentTree(original_indices)
        
        unplaced = 0
        
        for fruit in fruits:
            # Binary search for first basket with enough capacity

            if pos == n:
                # No basket can hold this fruit
                unplaced += 1
                continue

            if min_idx == float('inf'):
                # No available basket found
                unplaced += 1
            else:
                # Use reverse mapping to find position instantly
                sorted_pos = idx_to_pos[min_idx]
                seg_tree.update(0, 0, n - 1, sorted_pos, float('inf'))
