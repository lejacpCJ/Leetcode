# 3487. Maximum Unique Subarray Sum After Deletion

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-unique-subarray-sum-after-deletion/)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You are allowed to delete any number of elements from `nums` without making it empty. After performing the deletions, select a subarray of `nums` such that:

- All elements in the subarray are unique.
- The sum of the elements in the subarray is maximized.

Return the maximum sum of such a subarray.

## Example

Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
Output: `15`  
Explanation: Select the entire array without deleting any element to obtain the maximum sum.

Input: `nums = [1,1,0,1,1]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: Delete the element nums[0] == 1, nums[1] == 1, nums[2] == 0, and nums[3] == 1. Select the entire array [1] to obtain the maximum sum.

Input: `nums = [1,2,-1,-2,1,0,-1]`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: Delete the elements nums[2] == -1 and nums[3] == -2, and select the subarray [2, 1] from [1, 2, 1, 0, -1] to obtain the maximum sum.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## Solution

Since we can delete any elements and rearrange the remaining ones, we only need to consider positive unique values. We use a set to track seen numbers and sum only positive unique elements.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize `res` to store the answer, `history` set to track seen numbers, and `hasAdded` flag to ensure we don't return empty result.
2. Iterate through `nums`. If `num <= 0` or `num` already exists in `history`, continue.
3. Otherwise, add `num` to `history`, add `num` to `res`, and set `hasAdded` to `True`.
4. If `hasAdded` is `False` at the end, it means all numbers are non-positive, so return `max(nums)`.
5. Otherwise, return `res`.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space:** O(n), for the set to store unique elements.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def maxUniqueSubarraySum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        history = set()
        hasAdded = False
        
        for num in nums:
            if num <= 0 or num in history:
                continue
            history.add(num)
            res += num
            hasAdded = True
        
        if not hasAdded:
            return max(nums)
        
        return res
```
