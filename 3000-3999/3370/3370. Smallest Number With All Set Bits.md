# 3370. Smallest Number With All Set Bits

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Math, Bit Manipulation
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-number-with-all-set-bits/)

## Description

You are given a positive number `n`.

Return the smallest number `x` greater than or equal to `n`, such that the binary representation of `x` contains only set bits.

## Examples

- **Input:** `n = 5`  
  **Output:** `7`  
  **Explanation:** The binary representation of 7 is `"111"`.

- **Input:** `n = 10`  
  **Output:** `15`  
  **Explanation:** The binary representation of 15 is `"1111"`.

- **Input:** `n = 3`  
  **Output:** `3`  
  **Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 is `"11"`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= n <= 1000`

---

## Solution

1. **Find the bit length:** Determine the number of bits needed to represent `n`.
2. **Construct the answer:** The smallest number with all set bits of that length is `2^bit_len - 1`.
3. **Return the result:** This value is always greater than or equal to `n` for the computed bit length.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(1)
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        bit_len = len(bin(n)) - 2
        return 2 ** bit_len - 1
```
