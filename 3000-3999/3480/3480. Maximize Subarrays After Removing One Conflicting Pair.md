# 3480. Maximize Subarrays After Removing One Conflicting Pair

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Topics:** Array, Segment Tree, Enumeration, Prefix Sum
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-subarrays-after-removing-one-conflicting-pair/)

## Description

You are given an integer n which represents an array nums containing the numbers from 1 to n in order. Additionally, you are given a 2D array conflictingPairs, where conflictingPairs[i] = [a, b] indicates that a and b form a conflicting pair.

Remove exactly one element from conflictingPairs. Afterward, count the number of non-empty subarrays of nums which do not contain both a and b for any remaining conflicting pair [a, b].

Return the maximum number of subarrays possible after removing exactly one conflicting pair.

## Example

Input: `n = 5`, `conflictingPairs = [[1,2],[2,5],[3,5]]`  
Output: `12`  
Explanation: Remove [1, 2] from conflictingPairs. Now, conflictingPairs = [[2, 5], [3, 5]]. There are 12 subarrays in nums where [2, 5] and [3, 5] do not appear together.

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= conflictingPairs.length <= 2 * n`
- `conflictingPairs[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= conflictingPairs[i][j] <= n`
- `conflictingPairs[i][0] != conflictingPairs[i][1]`

## Solution

Use a **sweep line approach** by grouping pairs by their right endpoints and tracking the most restrictive constraints. This approach is more intuitive than sorting pairs.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Group pairs by right endpoint**: For each position, store all left endpoints of pairs ending there
2. **Sweep left to right**: Process each position while maintaining the two largest left endpoints
3. **Calculate valid subarrays**: For each position, count subarrays that don't violate any constraints
4. **Track removal gains**: Calculate potential benefit from removing each constraining pair
5. **Return optimal result**: Total valid subarrays plus maximum gain from any single removal

**Key Insights:**
- At position `i`, valid subarrays can start from any position > second largest left endpoint
- Removing a pair with left endpoint `L` frees up subarrays that were blocked only by that pair
- We only need to track the two most restrictive (largest) left endpoints

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n + m), where n is array size and m is number of conflicting pairs.
- **Space:** O(n + m), for storing pairs grouped by endpoints.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxSubarrays(self, n: int, conflictingPairs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Group pairs by their right endpoints
        right = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
        
        for a, b in conflictingPairs:
            right[max(a, b)].append(min(a, b))
        
        res = 0                    # Total valid subarrays keeping all pairs
        max_lefts = [0, 0]        # Track two largest left endpoints
        gain = defaultdict(int)   # Potential gain from removing each left endpoint
        
        # Sweep from left to right
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            # Process all pairs ending at position i
            for l in right[i]:
                max_lefts.append(l)
                max_lefts.sort()     # Keep only largest 2 (max 3 elements total)
                max_lefts.pop(0)     # Remove smallest
            
            # Count valid subarrays ending at position i
            # Can start from any position > max_lefts[1] (second largest left)
            res += (i - max_lefts[1])
            
            # Calculate gain from removing the pair with left endpoint max_lefts[1]
            # This frees up subarrays blocked only by this pair
            gain[max_lefts[1]] += (max_lefts[1] - max_lefts[0])
        
        # Return total valid subarrays plus maximum possible gain
        return res + max(gain.values())
```
