# 961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/)

## Description

You are given an integer array `nums` with the following properties:

- `nums.length == 2 * n`.
- `nums` contains `n + 1` unique elements.
- Exactly one element of `nums` is repeated `n` times.

Return the element that is repeated `n` times.

## Examples

- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,3]`  
  **Output:** `3`

- **Input:** `nums = [2,1,2,5,3,2]`  
  **Output:** `2`

- **Input:** `nums = [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]`  
  **Output:** `5`

## Constraints

- `2 <= n <= 5000`
- `nums.length == 2 * n`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `nums` contains `n + 1` unique elements and one of them is repeated exactly `n` times.

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate through the array:** Use a hash table to track seen elements.
2. **Return on repeat:** As soon as an element is seen again, return it (since only one element is repeated `n` times).

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space:** O(n), for the hash table.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen = set()
        for num in nums:
            if num in seen:
                return num
            seen.add(num)
```
