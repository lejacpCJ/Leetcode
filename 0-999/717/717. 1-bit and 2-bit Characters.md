# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/)

## Description

You are given a binary array `bits` that ends with `0`. There are two special characters:

- The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
- The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Return `true` if the last character must be a one-bit character.

## Examples

- Input: `bits = [1,0,0]`  
  Output: `true`  
  Explanation: The only way to decode is `[10, 0]` (two-bit character and one-bit character). So the last character is a one-bit character.

- Input: `bits = [1,1,1,0]`  
  Output: `false`  
  Explanation: The only way to decode is `[11, 10]` (two-bit character and two-bit character). So the last character is not a one-bit character.

## Constraints

- `1 <= bits.length <= 1000`
- `bits[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate through bits:** Start from the first index and move forward.
2. **Jump by character size:** If you see a `1`, jump two steps (two-bit character). If you see a `0`, jump one step (one-bit character).
3. **Check last position:** If you land exactly on the last index, the last character is a one-bit character.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of `bits`.
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def isOneBitCharacter(self, bits: List[int]) -> bool:
        i = 0
        n = len(bits)
        while i < n - 1:
            if bits[i] == 1:
                i += 2
            else:
                i += 1
        return i == n - 1
```
