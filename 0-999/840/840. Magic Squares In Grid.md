## Description

A 3 x 3 magic square is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from 1 to 9 such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a `row x col` grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 magic square subgrids are there?

Note: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, the grid may contain numbers up to 15.

### Example 1

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:
4 3 8
9 5 1
2 7 6
```

### Example 2

```
Input: grid = [[8]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints

- `row == grid.length`
- `col == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= row, col <= 10`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15`

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate over all possible 3x3 subgrids** in the given grid.
2. **Check if each subgrid is a magic square**:
   - All numbers are distinct and in the range 1 to 9.
   - All rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15.
3. **Count the number of valid magic squares**.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(m \* n), where m and n are the grid dimensions (since each 3x3 subgrid is checked in constant time).
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def numMagicSquaresInside(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        def isMagic(i, j):
            s = [grid[x][y] for x in range(i, i+3) for y in range(j, j+3)]
            if sorted(s) != list(range(1, 10)):
                return False
            return (s[0] + s[1] + s[2] == 15 and
                    s[3] + s[4] + s[5] == 15 and
                    s[6] + s[7] + s[8] == 15 and
                    s[0] + s[3] + s[6] == 15 and
                    s[1] + s[4] + s[7] == 15 and
                    s[2] + s[5] + s[8] == 15 and
                    s[0] + s[4] + s[8] == 15 and
                    s[2] + s[4] + s[6] == 15)

        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        res = 0
        if n < 3 or m < 3:
            return res
        for i in range(m - 2):
            for j in range(n - 2):
                if isMagic(i, j):
                    res += 1
        return res
```
