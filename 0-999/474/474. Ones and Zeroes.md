# 474. Ones and Zeroes

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, String, Dynamic Programming
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/)

## Description

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are at most `m` 0's and `n` 1's in the subset.

A set `x` is a subset of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

## Examples

- **Input:** `strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"]`, `m = 5`, `n = 3`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** The largest subset with at most 5 0's and 3 1's is `{"10", "0001", "1", "0"}`, so the answer is 4.

- **Input:** `strs = ["10","0","1"]`, `m = 1`, `n = 1`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The largest subset is `{"0", "1"}`, so the answer is 2.

## Constraints

- `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
- `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists only of digits '0' and '1'.
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

## Solution

1. **Count zeros and ones:** For each string, count the number of 0's and 1's.
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` to represent the maximum subset size with at most `i` 1's and `j` 0's.
3. **Iterate and update:** For each string, update the DP array in reverse to avoid overwriting needed values.
4. **Return result:** The answer is the maximum value in the DP array.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(L _ m _ n), where L is the number of strings.
- **Space:** O(m \* n)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def findMaxForm(self, strs: List[str], m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]

        # Preprocess: count zeros and ones for each string
        counts = [(s.count('0'), s.count('1')) for s in strs]

        for zero, one in counts:
            for i in range(n, one - 1, -1):
                for j in range(m, zero - 1, -1):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - one][j - zero] + 1)

        return max(max(row) for row in dp)
```
