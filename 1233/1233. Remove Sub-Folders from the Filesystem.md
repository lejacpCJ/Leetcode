## Description

Given a list of folders `folder`, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of `folder[j]` must start with `folder[j]`, followed by a "/". For example, `"/a/b"` is a sub-folder of `"/a"`, but `"/b"` is not a sub-folder of `"/a/b/c"`.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `'/'` followed by one or more lowercase English letters.

For example, `"/leetcode"` and `"/leetcode/problems"` are valid paths while an empty string and `"/"` are not.

## Example

Input: `folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]`  
Output: `["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]`  
Explanation: Folders `"/a/b"` is a subfolder of `"/a"` and `"/c/d/e"` is inside of folder `"/c/d"` in our filesystem.

## Constraints

- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and `'/'`.
- `folder[i]` always starts with the character `'/'`.
- Each folder name is unique.

## Solution

The key idea is to sort the folder paths and only keep a folder if it is not a sub-folder of the previous one kept.

1. Sort the folder list lexicographically.
2. Iterate through the list and for each folder, check if it starts with the last added plus a `'/'`. If it does, skip it (it's a sub-folder). Otherwise, add it to the result.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def removeSubfolders(self, folder: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        folder.sort()
        res = []
        for f in folder:
            if not res or not f.startswith(res[-1] + '/'):
                res.append(f)
        return res
```

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n log n), for sorting.  
- Space: O(n), for iterating through the list.
