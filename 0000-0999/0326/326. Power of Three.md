## Description

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^x`.

## Examples

- Input: `n = 27`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: `27 = 3^3`

- Input: `n = 0`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: There is no x where `3^x = 0`.

- Input: `n = -1`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: There is no x where `3^x = (-1)`.

## Constraints

- `-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`

---

## Solution

1. **Handle edge cases**: Return `false` for non-positive numbers (powers of 3 are always positive)
2. **Iterative division**: Keep dividing `n` by 3 while it's divisible
3. **Check result**: If we reach 1, then `n` was a power of 3; otherwise, it wasn't

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(logâ‚ƒ n), where we divide by 3 until we reach 1 or find a non-divisible remainder
- **Space:** O(1), using only constant extra space

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfThree(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        while n > 0:
            if n == 1:
                return True
            if n % 3 != 0:
                return False
            n = n // 3
```
