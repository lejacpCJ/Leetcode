# 904. Fruit Into Baskets

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Array, Hash Table, Sliding Window

## Description

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit the `ith` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:

- You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit. There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
- Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the starting tree) while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
- Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in either basket, you must stop.

Given the integer array `fruits`, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.

## Examples

- Input: `fruits = [1,2,3,2,2]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: We can pick from trees [2,3,2,2]. If we had started at the first tree, we would only pick from trees [1,2].

## Constraints

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= fruits[i] < fruits.length`

## Solution

1. **Sliding window**: Maintain a window with at most 2 distinct fruit types
2. **Expand window**: Move right pointer and add fruits to current collection
3. **Track fruit types**: Use a hash map to count occurrences of each fruit type
4. **Shrink window**: When we have more than 2 fruit types, shrink from left until valid
5. **Track maximum**: Keep track of the maximum window size seen

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the number of trees
- **Space:** O(1), since we store at most 3 fruit types in the hash map

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def totalFruit(self, fruits: List[int]) -> int:
        max_fruits = 0  
        left = 0        
        fruit_count = defaultdict(int)  
        
        # Iterate through all trees with right pointer
        for right in range(len(fruits)):
            fruit_count[fruits[right]] += 1

            # Shrink window from left while we have more than 2 fruit types
            while len(fruit_count) > 2:
                # Remove leftmost fruit
                fruit_count[fruits[left]] -= 1
                if fruit_count[fruits[left]] == 0:
                    del fruit_count[fruits[left]]
                left += 1
            
            max_fruits = max(max_fruits, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_fruits
```
