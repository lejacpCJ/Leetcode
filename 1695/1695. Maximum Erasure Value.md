## Description

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

An array `b` is called to be a subarray of `a` if it forms a contiguous subsequence of `a`, that is, if it is equal to `a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r]` for some `(l, r)`.

## Example

Input: `nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5]`  
Output: `8`  
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is `[5,2,1]` or `[1,2,5]`.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

---

## Solution

We use a sliding window and a dictionary to keep track of the last index where each number was seen.

**Steps:**
1. Keep a dictionary to store the last index of each number seen.
2. Iterate through `nums`.
3. If the current number is in the dictionary and its last index is greater than or equal to the current window's start, use a while loop to subtract `nums[start]` from the current sum and increment `start` until `start` is greater than the last index of the current number.
4. Add the current number to the current sum and update its index in the dictionary.
5. Update the maximum score found so far.

**Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`. Each element is added and removed from the window at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the dictionary storing the last index of each unique number.

**Python Code:**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumUniqueSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        num_index = {}
        max_score = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        start = 0

        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # If num is already in the window, move start pointer
            if num in num_index and num_index[num] >= start:
                while start <= num_index[num]:
                    curr_sum -= nums[start]
                    start += 1
            curr_sum += num
            num_index[num] = i
            max_score = max(max_score, curr_sum)
        return max_score
```
