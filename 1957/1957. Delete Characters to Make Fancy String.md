# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** String
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/)

## Description

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the minimum possible number of characters from `s` to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

## Example

Input: `s = "leeetcode"`  
Output: `"leetcode"`  
Explanation: Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode". No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".


## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

---

## Solution

**Steps:**

We can build the answer by iterating through the string and only adding a character if the last two characters in the result are not both equal to the current character.

**Complexity:**  
- Time: O(n), where n is the length of `s`.
- Space: O(n), for the result string.

**Python Code:**
```python
class Solution:
    def makeFancyString(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = []
        for c in s:
            if len(res) >= 2 and res[-1] == res[-2] == c:
                continue
            res.append(c)
        return ''.join(res)
```
