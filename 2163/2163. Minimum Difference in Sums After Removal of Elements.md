## Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements.

You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly `n` from `nums`. The remaining `2 * n` elements will be divided into two equal parts:

- The first `n` elements belonging to the first part and their sum is `sumfirst`.
- The next `n` elements belonging to the second part and their sum is `sumsecond`.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as `sumfirst - sumsecond`.

For example, if `sumfirst = 3` and `sumsecond = 2`, their difference is `1`.  
Similarly, if `sumfirst = 2` and `sumsecond = 3`, their difference is `-1`.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of `n` elements.

## Example

Input: `nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation:  
Here `n = 2`. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove `nums[2] = 5` and `nums[3] = 8`, the resultant array will be `[7,9,1,3]`. The difference in sums will be `(7+9) - (1+3) = 12`.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove `nums[1] = 9` and `nums[4] = 1`. The resultant array becomes `[7,5,8,3]`. The difference in sums of the two parts is `(7+5) - (8+3) = 1`.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

## Constraints

- `nums.length == 3 * n`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

---

## Solution

**Steps:**
- Use a max-heap to keep track of the smallest possible sum of n elements from the left.
- Use a min-heap to keep track of the largest possible sum of n elements from the right.
- For each possible partition, compute the difference and return the minimum.

**Complexity:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the value of `n` in the problem. Each heap operation takes O(log n) time, and we perform these operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the heaps and the prefix/suffix sum arrays.

**Python Code**
``` Python 
import heapq
from typing import List
class Solution:
    def minimumDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums) // 3
        left_sum = [0] * 3 * n
        right_sum = [0] * 3 * n
        
        heap = []
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(2 * n):
            heapq.heappush(heap, -nums[i])
            curr_sum += nums[i]

            if len(heap) > n:
                curr_sum -= -heapq.heappop(heap)
            if len(heap) == n:
                left_sum[i] = curr_sum
            else:
                left_sum[i] = float('inf')

        heap = []
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(3 * n - 1, n - 1, -1):
            heapq.heappush(heap, nums[i])
            curr_sum += nums[i]

            if len(heap) > n:
                curr_sum -= heapq.heappop(heap)
            if len(heap) == n:
                right_sum[i] = curr_sum
            else:
                right_sum[i] = float('-inf')
        
        res = float('inf')
        for i in range(n -1 , 2 * n):
            res = min(res, left_sum[i] - right_sum[i+1])

        return res
