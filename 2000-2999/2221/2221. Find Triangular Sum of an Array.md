## Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a digit between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

The triangular sum of `nums` is the value of the only element present in `nums` after the following process terminates:

- Let `nums` comprise of `n` elements. If `n == 1`, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array `newNums` of length `n - 1`.
- For each index `i`, where `0 <= i < n - 1`, assign the value of `newNums[i]` as `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`, where `%` denotes modulo operator.
- Replace the array `nums` with `newNums`.
- Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the triangular sum of `nums`.

## Examples

- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`  
  **Output:** `8`  
  **Explanation:**  
  The above diagram depicts the process from which we obtain the triangular sum of the array.

- **Input:** `nums = [5]`  
  **Output:** `5`  
  **Explanation:**  
  Since there is only one element in `nums`, the triangular sum is the value of that element itself.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 9`

---

## Solution

We can observe that the process is similar to constructing the last row of Pascal's triangle modulo 10, where each element's coefficient is a binomial coefficient. Thus, the result can be computed directly using combinatorics.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize `res` as 0 and `coef` as 1.
2. For each index `i` from 1 to `n`:
   - Add `nums[i-1] * coef` to `res`, modulo 10.
   - Update `coef` to the next binomial coefficient.
3. Return `res`.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n)
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def triangularSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        n = len(nums)
        coef = 1
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            res += nums[i-1] * coef
            res %= 10
            coef = coef * (n - i) // i
        return res
```
