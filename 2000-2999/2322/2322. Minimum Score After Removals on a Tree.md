## Description

There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length n where `nums[i]` represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` of length n - 1 where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

1. Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
2. The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.

Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.

## Example

Input: `nums = [1,5,5,4,11]`, `edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]`  
Output: `9`  
Explanation: Remove edges [0,1] and [1,2]. The three components have XOR values 1, 5, and 10. Score = 10 - 1 = 9.

## Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `3 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^8`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= ai, bi < n`
- `ai != bi`
- `edges` represents a valid tree.

## Solution

Try all possible pairs of edge removals and calculate the minimum score. The key insight is to precompute subtree XOR values and use DFS timestamps to determine ancestor relationships between nodes.

**Steps:**

1. Build adjacency list and run DFS for:
   - Subtree XOR values for each node
   - Parent relationships
   - Enter/exit timestamps for ancestor checking
2. For each pair of edges, determine cases (nested or disjoint subtrees)
3. Calculate XOR values for the three resulting components based on the relationship
4. Track the minimum score

**Key Optimization:**
- Use DFS timestamps to check ancestor relationship in O(1) time
- Node `a` is ancestor of node `b` if `enter_time[a] ≤ enter_time[b] ≤ exit_time[b] ≤ exit_time[a]`

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes.
- **Space:** O(n), for the adjacency list and DFS recursion stack.

**Python Code:**
