# 2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array

## Description

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. An index `i` is part of a hill in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are smaller than `nums[i]`. Similarly, an index `i` is part of a valley in `nums` if the closest non-equal neighbors of `i` are larger than `nums[i]`. Adjacent indices `i` and `j` are part of the same hill or valley if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.

Return the number of hills and valleys in `nums`.

## Example

Input: `nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]`  
Output: `0`  
Explanation:
- At index 0: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 0 is neither a hill nor a valley.
- At index 1: There is no non-equal neighbor of 6 on the left, so index 1 is neither a hill nor a valley.
- At index 2: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 2 is neither a hill nor a valley.
- At index 3: The closest non-equal neighbors of 5 are 6 and 4. Since 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, index 3 is neither a hill nor a valley.
- At index 4: The closest non-equal neighbors of 4 are 5 and 1. Since 4 < 5 and 4 > 1, index 4 is neither a hill nor a valley.
- At index 5: There is no non-equal neighbor of 1 on the right, so index 5 is neither a hill nor a valley.

There are 0 hills and valleys so we return 0.

## Constraints

- `3 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

---

## Solution

1. **Remove consecutive duplicates**: Scan through `nums` and create a new list `nums_set` that eliminates adjacent identical numbers, since consecutive equal values are considered part of the same hill or valley.

2. **Check hill/valley conditions**: Scan `nums_set` from index 1 to `len(nums_set) - 1` and check if each element forms a hill or valley by comparing with its left and right neighbors.

3. **Count valid hills and valleys**: An element is a hill if both neighbors are smaller, and a valley if both neighbors are larger.


**Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array
- **Space:** O(n), for storing the deduplicated array

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums_set = [nums[0]]
        
        # Remove consecutive duplicates
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == nums_set[-1]:
                continue
            nums_set.append(nums[i])
        
        # Count hills and valleys
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums_set) - 1):
            if ((nums_set[i-1] > nums_set[i] and nums_set[i+1] > nums_set[i]) or
                (nums_set[i-1] < nums_set[i] and nums_set[i+1] < nums_set[i])):
                res += 1
        
        return res
```
