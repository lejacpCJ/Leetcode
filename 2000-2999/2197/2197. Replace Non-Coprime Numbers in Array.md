- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Topics:** Array, Math, Stack

## Description

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following steps:

- Find any two adjacent numbers in `nums` that are non-coprime.
- If no such numbers are found, stop the process.
- Otherwise, delete the two numbers and replace them with their LCM (Least Common Multiple).
- Repeat this process as long as you keep finding two adjacent non-coprime numbers.
- Return the final modified array. It can be shown that replacing adjacent non-coprime numbers in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 10⁸.

Two values `x` and `y` are non-coprime if `GCD(x, y) > 1` where `GCD(x, y)` is the Greatest Common Divisor of `x` and `y`.

## Examples

- Input: `nums = [6,4,3,2,7,6,2]`  
  Output: `[12,7,6]`  
  Explanation:  
  - (6, 4) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 4) = 12. Now, nums = [12,3,2,7,6,2].
  - (12, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 3) = 12. Now, nums = [12,2,7,6,2].
  - (12, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(12, 2) = 12. Now, nums = [12,7,6,2].
  - (6, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(6, 2) = 6. Now, nums = [12,7,6].
  - There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
  - Thus, the final modified array is [12,7,6].

- Input: `nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3,3]`  
  Output: `[2,1,1,3]`  
  Explanation:  
  - (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3,3].
  - (3, 3) are non-coprime with LCM(3, 3) = 3. Now, nums = [2,2,1,1,3].
  - (2, 2) are non-coprime with LCM(2, 2) = 2. Now, nums = [2,1,1,3].
  - There are no more adjacent non-coprime numbers in nums.
  - Thus, the final modified array is [2,1,1,3].

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- The test cases are generated such that the values in the final array are less than or equal to 10^8.

## Solution

1. **Use a stack:** Iterate through the array, maintaining a stack of numbers.
2. **Merge non-coprime adjacent numbers:** For each number, keep merging it with the top of the stack as long as the top and the current number are non-coprime (GCD > 1), replacing them with their LCM.
3. **Return the stack:** After processing all numbers, the stack contains the final modified array.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n log M), where n is the length of the array and M is the maximum value in nums (due to GCD/LCM calculations).
- **Space:** O(n), for the stack.

**Python Code:**

```python
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def replaceNonCoprimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        for num in nums:
            while stack and math.gcd(stack[-1], num) > 1:
                num = math.lcm(stack.pop(), num)
            stack.append(num)
        return stack
```
