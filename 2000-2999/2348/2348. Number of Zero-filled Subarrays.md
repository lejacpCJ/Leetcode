## Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays filled with `0`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Examples

- **Input:** `nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]`  
  **Output:** `6`  
  **Explanation:**  
  There are 4 occurrences of `[0]` as a subarray.  
  There are 2 occurrences of `[0,0]` as a subarray.  
  There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6.

- **Input:** `nums = [0,0,0,2,0,0]`  
  **Output:** `9`  
  **Explanation:**  
  There are 5 occurrences of `[0]` as a subarray.  
  There are 3 occurrences of `[0,0]` as a subarray.  
  There is 1 occurrence of `[0,0,0]` as a subarray.  
  There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 3 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 9.

- **Input:** `nums = [2,10,2019]`  
  **Output:** `0`  
  **Explanation:**  
  There is no subarray filled with 0. Therefore, we return 0.

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate through the array:** Track the length of the current sequence of consecutive zeros.
2. **Count subarrays:** For each sequence of `n` consecutive zeros, the number of zero-filled subarrays is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
3. **Aggregate the result:** Add up the counts for all zero sequences.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.
- **Space:** O(1), constant extra space.

**Python Code:**

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def zeroFilledSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def trapezoid(n):
            return n * (n + 1) // 2
        
        res = 0
        curr = 0

        for num in nums:
            if num == 0:
                curr += 1
            else:
                res += trapezoid(curr)
                curr = 0
        res += trapezoid(curr)  # Add the last sequence if it ends with zeros

        return res
```
