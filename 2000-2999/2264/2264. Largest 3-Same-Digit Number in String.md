# 2264. Largest 3-Same-Digit Number in String

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** String
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-3-same-digit-number-in-string/)

## Description

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:

- It is a substring of `num` with length 3.
- It consists of only one unique digit.

Return the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string `""` if no such integer exists.

**Note:**
- A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
- There may be leading zeroes in `num` or a good integer.

## Examples

- **Input:** `num = "6777133339"`
  - **Output:** `"777"`
  - **Explanation:** There are two distinct good integers: `"777"` and `"333"`. `"777"` is the largest, so we return `"777"`.

- **Input:** `num = "2300019"`
  - **Output:** `"000"`
  - **Explanation:** `"000"` is the only good integer.

- **Input:** `num = "42352338"`
  - **Output:** `""`
  - **Explanation:** No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit.

## Constraints

- `3 <= num.length <= 1000`
- `num` only consists of digits.

---

## Solution

1. **Iterate through substrings:** Check every substring of length 3 in `num`.
2. **Check for good integer:** If all three digits in the substring are the same, it's a good integer.
3. **Track the largest:** Keep track of the largest digit found in such substrings.
4. **Return result:** If a good integer is found, return it as a string of length 3; otherwise, return an empty string.

**Complexity:**
- **Time:** O(n), where n is the length of `num`.
- **Space:** O(1), only a few variables are used.

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def largestGoodInteger(self, num: str) -> str:
        max_good = -1  # Store the largest digit found in a good integer
        
        # Iterate through all substrings of length 3
        for i in range(len(num) - 2):
            if num[i] == num[i + 1] and num[i + 1] == num[i + 2]:
                # Update max_good if this digit is larger
                max_good = max(max_good, int(num[i]))
        
        # If no good integer was found, return empty string
        if max_good == -1:
            return ""
        # Return the largest good integer as a string of length 3
        return str(max_good) * 3
```
