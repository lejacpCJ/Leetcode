# 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Topics:** Array, String, Simulation
- [Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/final-value-of-variable-after-performing-operations/)

## Description

You are given an array of strings `operations` containing a list of operations on a variable `X`, which is initially 0. The operations are:

- `"++X"` and `"X++"`: increment `X` by 1
- `"--X"` and `"X--"`: decrement `X` by 1

Return the final value of `X` after performing all operations.

## Examples

- Input: `operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]`  
  Output: `1`  
  Explanation:

  - Initially, X = 0
  - "--X": X = -1
  - "X++": X = 0
  - "X++": X = 1

- Input: `operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]`  
  Output: `3`  
  Explanation:

  - Initially, X = 0
  - "++X": X = 1
  - "++X": X = 2
  - "X++": X = 3

- Input: `operations = ["X++","++X","--X","X--"]`  
  Output: `0`  
  Explanation:
  - Initially, X = 0
  - "X++": X = 1
  - "++X": X = 2
  - "--X": X = 1
  - "X--": X = 0

## Constraints

- `1 <= operations.length <= 100`
- `operations[i]` is one of `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, `"X--"`

---

## Solution

1. **Initialize result**: Start with `res = 0`
2. **Iterate through operations**: For each operation, increment or decrement `res` based on the operation type
3. **Return result**: After processing all operations, return `res`

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(n), where n is the number of operations
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0

        for op in operations:
            if '+' in op:
                res += 1
            else:
                res -= 1

        return res
```
