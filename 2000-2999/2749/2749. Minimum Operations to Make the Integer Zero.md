## Problem Info

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Topics:** Bit Manipulation, Brainteaser, Enumeration

## Description

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and subtract `2^i + num2` from `num1`.

Return the integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to make `num1` equal to `0`.

If it is impossible to make `num1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.

## Examples

- Input: `num1 = 3`, `num2 = -2`  
  Output: `3`  
  Explanation:  
  We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:  
  - Choose `i = 2` and subtract `2^2 + (-2)` from 3: `3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1`.  
  - Choose `i = 2` and subtract `2^2 + (-2)` from 1: `1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1`.  
  - Choose `i = 0` and subtract `2^0 + (-2)` from -1: `-1 - (1 + (-2)) = 0`.  
  It can be proven that 3 is the minimum number of operations needed.

- Input: `num1 = 5`, `num2 = 7`  
  Output: `-1`  
  Explanation:  
  It can be proven that it is impossible to make 5 equal to 0 with the given operation.

## Constraints

- `1 <= num1 <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= num2 <= 10^9`

---

## Solution

1. **Try all possible operation counts:** For each possible number of operations `k` from 1 to 60, check if it's possible to reach 0.
2. **Calculate the remaining value:** For each `k`, compute `m = num1 - k * num2`.
3. **Check feasibility:** If `m < k`, it's impossible (since we need at least `k` ones in binary to use `k` operations).
4. **Check binary representation:** If the number of set bits in `m` is less than or equal to `k`, it's possible to reach 0 in `k` operations.

**Complexity:**

- **Time:** O(60) (constant time, since we only check up to 60 operations)
- **Space:** O(1)

**Python Code:**

```python
import math

class Solution:
    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        for k in range(1, 61):
            m = num1 - k * num2
            if m < k:
                break
            if bin(m).count("1") <= k:
                return k
        return -1
```
