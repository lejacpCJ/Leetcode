## Description

Anti-theft security devices are activated inside a bank. You are given a 0-indexed binary string array `bank` representing the floor plan of the bank, which is an m x n 2D matrix. `bank[i]` represents the ith row, consisting of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. `'0'` means the cell is empty, while `'1'` means the cell has a security device.

There is one laser beam between any two security devices if both conditions are met:

- The two devices are located on two different rows: r1 and r2, where r1 < r2.
- For each row i where r1 < i < r2, there are no security devices in the ith row.

Laser beams are independent, i.e., one beam does not interfere nor join with another.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.

## Examples

Example 1:

- Input: `bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]`
- Output: `8`
- Explanation: Between each of the following device pairs, there is one beam. In total, there are 8 beams:
  - bank[0][1] -- bank[2][1]
  - bank[0][1] -- bank[2][3]
  - bank[0][2] -- bank[2][1]
  - bank[0][2] -- bank[2][3]
  - bank[0][5] -- bank[2][1]
  - bank[0][5] -- bank[2][3]
  - bank[2][1] -- bank[3][2]
  - bank[2][3] -- bank[3][2]
    Note that there is no beam between any device on the 0th row with any on the 3rd row because the 2nd row contains security devices, which breaks the second condition.

Example 2:

- Input: `bank = ["000","111","000"]`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: There does not exist two devices located on two different rows that satisfy the conditions.

## Constraints

- m == bank.length
- n == bank[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 500
- bank[i][j] is either '0' or '1'.

---

## Solution

Idea:

- For each row that contains devices (a row with at least one '1'), count the number of devices in that row.
- Only rows with devices that are consecutive in the sequence of non-empty rows can form beams. For each such pair of consecutive non-empty rows, the number of beams equals the product of their device counts.
- Sum those products over all consecutive non-empty rows.

Steps:

1. Iterate rows top to bottom.
2. If a row has no '1', skip it.
3. Count '1's in the row.
4. Add prev_count \* current_count to result and set prev_count = current_count.

Complexity:

- Time: O(m \* n) â€” counting 1s in each row.
- Space: O(1).

Python Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfBeams(self, bank: List[str]) -> int:
        res = 0
        prev_devices = 0
        for row in bank:
            if "1" not in row:
                continue
            devices = row.count("1")
            res += prev_devices * devices
            prev_devices = devices
        return res
```
