## Description

You are given an integer array `nums`.  
A subsequence `sub` of `nums` with length `x` is called **valid** if it satisfies:

```
(sub[0] + sub[1]) % 2 == (sub[1] + sub[2]) % 2 == ... == (sub[x - 2] + sub[x - 1]) % 2
```

Return the length of the longest valid subsequence of `nums`.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

---

## Solution

**Steps:**
This solution considers three possible types of valid subsequences:

- **All odd numbers:** The sum of any two odd numbers is even, so a subsequence of only odd numbers is valid.
- **All even numbers:** The sum of any two even numbers is also even, so a subsequence of only even numbers is valid.
- **Alternating parity:** By tracking the longest subsequence where each number alternates between odd and even, the sum of consecutive pairs will always be odd, which is also valid.

The algorithm counts the number of odd and even numbers, and also finds the length of the longest alternating odd-even subsequence. It returns the maximum of these three values as the answer. This approach ensures all possible valid subsequence types are considered efficiently in a single pass through the array.

>**Complexity:**
The solution uses a single for loop to iterate through the array, making it **O(n)** time complexity, where *n* is the length of `nums`.  
Space complexity is **O(1)**, since only a few counters and variables are used regardless of input size.

**Python Code**
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximumLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Returns the length of the longest valid subsequence in nums.
        A valid subsequence has all consecutive pairs with the same parity sum.
        """
        # Count of odd numbers in nums
        odd_count = 1 if nums[0] % 2 == 1 else 0
        # Count of even numbers in nums
        even_count = 0 if nums[0] % 2 == 1 else 1
        # Length of the longest alternating parity subsequence
        max_alternating = 1
        # Track the last number in the current alternating sequence
        last_num = nums[0]

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
                odd_count += 1
            else:
                even_count += 1

            # If parity changes, extend the alternating sequence
            if nums[i] % 2 != last_num % 2:
                max_alternating += 1
                last_num = nums[i]

        # The answer is the maximum among all possible valid subsequence types
        return max(odd_count, even_count, max_alternating)
```
